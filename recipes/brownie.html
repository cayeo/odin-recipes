    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Know the secret to gooey brownies? Don’t overcook them, and dot through
      caramel or chocolates filled with liquid caramel or ganache to help add
      moisture
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>150g butter cubed</li>
      <li>75g light soft brown sugar</li>
      <li>150g plain chocolate broken into pieces</li>
      <li>1 tbsp golden syrup</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>125g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>150g plain flour</li>
      <li>&#xBD; tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>3 tbsp cocoa powder plus more to dust</li>
      <li>4-6 tbsp dulce de leche</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a 20cm square cake tin with
        baking parchment. Melt together the butter, brown sugar, chocolate and
        golden syrup gently on a low heat until it is smooth. Remove the pan
        from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the eggs and caster sugar in a large bowl until light and
        fluffy – this will take a few minutes and is worth doing properly. Add
        the vanilla extract, then sift over the flour, baking powder and cocoa
        powder and add the chocolate mixture. Fold everything together quickly
        and scoop half of the mixture into the tin. Dot over scoops of caramel
        or chocolate hazelnut spread and then scoop the rest of the brownie
        mixture over the top. Add more scoops of caramel or chocolate spread, if
        you like, and bake for 30 mins. The top of the mixture should now be set
        and slightly cracked looking, but the mixture underneath will still have
        a slight wobble.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before cutting into
        squares. Dust the tops with cocoa or icing sugar, if you like, or if
        serving as a dessert drizzle with more caramel. Will keep for 3 days in
        an airtight container.

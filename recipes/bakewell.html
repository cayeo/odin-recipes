      <li>4 tbsp raspberry jam</li>
      <li>raspberries</li>
    </ul>
    For the pastry:
    <ul>
      <li>125g butter</li>
      <li>185g plain flour</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>65g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>&#xBD; tsp vanilla exxtract</li>
    </ul>
    For the frangipane:
    <ul>
      <li>125g flaked almonds</li>
      <li>125g butter softened</li>
      <li>85g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>

    For the drizzle:

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the pastry, rub the butter into the flour and a pinch of salt in a
        mixing bowl with your fingers until crumbly. Mix in the egg yolks, sugar
        and vanilla until it forms a dough. Roll into a log, cover and chill for
        at least 1 hr or up to two days. Remove the pastry from the fridge and
        slice into rounds about 3mm thick. Use the rounds to cover a 20cm tart
        tin, then push them with your fingers so they completely cover the base
        and sides of the tin without any gaps and with a slight overhang. Chill
        or freeze the tart case for at least 1 hr.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking sheet inside to
        heat up. Prick the pastry case with a fork, then line with baking
        parchment, fill with baking beans and cook on the hot baking sheet for
        20 mins. Lift off the paper and beans, then bake for 10-15 mins more
        until golden brown. Remove the tart case from the oven and leave to
        cool. Turn down the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the frangipane. Tip the almonds into a frying pan and
        toast over a medium heat until light brown. Tip all but 1 tbsp of the
        toasted almonds into a food processor with the rest of the frangipane
        ingredients and blitz to a paste, then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, roll the marzipan out to a circle that fits the tart base
        and lay over the bottom. Spread the jam over the marzipan, then spread
        over the frangipane. Bake the tart for 45-50 mins until puffed up,
        golden and set with a very slight wobble. Trim any overhanging pastry
        and leave to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the drizzle, mix the icing sugar with the lemon juice in a bowl
        until you have a thick and drizzly icing. Carefully remove the tart from
        the tin, drizzle with the icing and scatter with the remaining almonds.
        Slice and serve with fresh raspberries and clotted cream, if you like.
